      "\n",
      "The randomized Gauss--Seidel method and its extension have attracted much attention recently and their convergence rates have been considered extensively. However, the convergence rates are usually determined by upper bounds, which cannot fully reflect the actual convergence. In this paper, we make a detailed analysis of their convergence behaviors. The analysis shows that the larger the singular value of $A$ is, the faster the error decays in the corresponding singular vector space, and the convergence directions are mainly driven by the large singular values at the beginning, then gradually driven by the small singular values, and finally by the smallest nonzero singular value. These results explain the phenomenon found in the extensive numerical experiments appearing in the literature that these two methods seem to converge faster at the beginning. Numerical examples are provided to confirm the above findings.\n",

      "Semi-infinite programs are a class of mathematical optimization problems with a finite number of decision variables and infinite constraints. As shown by Blankenship and Falk (Blankenship and Falk. \"Infinitely constrained optimization problems.\" Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications 19.2 (1976): 261-281.), a sequence of lower bounds which converges to the optimal objective value may be obtained with specially constructed finite approximations of the constraint set. In (Mitsos. \"Global optimization of semi-infinite programs via restriction of the right-hand side.\" Optimization 60.10-11 (2011): 1291-1308.), it is claimed that a modification of this lower bounding method involving approximate solution of the lower-level program yields convergent lower bounds. We show with a counterexample that this claim is false, and discuss what kind of approximate solution of the lower-level program is sufficient for correct behavior.\n",

      "The randomized Gauss--Seidel method and its extension have attracted much attention recently and their convergence rates have been considered extensively. However, the convergence rates are usually determined by upper bounds, which cannot fully reflect the actual convergence. In this paper, we make a detailed analysis of their convergence behaviors. The analysis shows that the larger the singular value of $A$ is, the faster the error decays in the corresponding singular vector space, and the convergence directions are mainly driven by the large singular values at the beginning, then gradually driven by the small singular values, and finally by the smallest nonzero singular value. These results explain the phenomenon found in the extensive numerical experiments appearing in the literature that these two methods seem to converge faster at the beginning. Numerical examples are provided to confirm the above fi\n"
